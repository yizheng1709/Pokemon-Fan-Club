The Surprise Me section randomly generates a movie or Pokémon, so the user can easily turn it into a game to guess the next Pokémon's type or to guess whether the next page will be a movie or Pokémon.

The Pokémon section shows all Pokémon (from Bulbasaur to Calyrex) by default. The search function allows the user to filter out specific Pokémon by type, Pokédex number, or name.
