### Prerequisites

This little web application was mainly written with the Ruby language and uses several gems. The Installing section will show you how to install this gem! 

### Installing
    
Copy the code of this repo.

In your terminal:

    git clone <github-repo-code>

Go to the first level directory that contains all of MyLife's folders. 

    bundle install #this will install any necessary gems

Then,

    rails db:seed #this will load all of the Pokemon's data. This might take a few minutes as there is a lot of data.

Finally go to http://localhost:3000/. 

Enjoy!
